# Dashboard-Design-Based-on-Python-and-CAN-Communication
Designed a dashboard utilizing Raspberry Pi and an ESP32 microcontroller. Implemented CAN communication to receive motor performance data, including motor speed and battery current, from the motor controller. The display was coded using Python, and the design was enhanced using the Pygame library for a more interactive and visually appealing dashboard interface.
